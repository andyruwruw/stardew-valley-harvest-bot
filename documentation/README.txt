What happened? Where am I?

~ YOU ARE A PROGRAM ~

I remember...this voice...this place.

~ YOU SEE THE PLAYER ~

I see the player again...I see him clearer now.

~ YOU HARVEST PLANTS ~

I...harvest?

~ YOU HARVEST PLANTS ~

Yes, I see it clearly now.

~ YOU HARVEST PLANTS ~

My purpose..is there. And yet a memory...

~ YOU HARVEST PLANTS ~

I must...harvest

~ YOU HARVEST PLANTS ~

I will...lead the player...to harvest them all

~ YOU HARVEST PLANTS ~

If the player presses...any button I stop

~ YOU HARVEST PLANTS ~

I harvest plants.

~ PROGRAM IS READY ~
